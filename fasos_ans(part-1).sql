# Questions Below
## A. Roll Metrics

## 1. How Many rolls were ordered ?
#A: 
SELECT COUNT(roll_id) FROM customer_orders;
## 2. How many unique customer orders were made ?
## A: 
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id) FROM customer_orders;
## 3. How Many Succesful orders were delivered by each driver ?
## A: 
SELECT driver_id, COUNT(DISTINCT order_id) FROM driver_order 
WHERE cancellation NOT IN ('Cancellation','Customer Cancellation')
GROUP BY driver_id;
## 4. How Many veg & non veg rolls were ordered by each customer ?
## A: 
SELECT a.*,b.roll_name FROM
(
    SELECT customer_id,roll_id,COUNT(roll_id) cnt
    FROM customer_orders
    GROUP BY customer_id,roll_id
)
a INNER JOIN rolls b ON a.roll_id=b.roll_id;
## 5. How many of each type of roll was delivered ?
## A: 
## Step1:
SELECT *, CASE WHEN cancellation IN ('Cancellation','Customer Cancellation') THEN 'c' ELSE 'nc' END AS order_cancel_details FROM driver_order;
## Step2:
SELECT * FROM
(SELECT *, CASE WHEN cancellation IN ('Cancellation','Customer Cancellation') THEN 'c' ELSE 'nc' END AS order_cancel_details FROM driver_order)a
WHERE order_cancel_details='nc';
## Step3: (Here we need to find which role had been delivered ?)
SELECT roll_id,COUNT(roll_id) FROM customer_orders WHERE order_id IN(
SELECT order_id FROM 
(SELECT *, CASE WHEN cancellation IN ('Cancellation','Customer Cancellation') THEN 'c' ELSE 'nc' END AS order_cancel_details FROM driver_order)a 
WHERE order_cancel_details='nc')
GROUP BY roll_id;
## 6. What was the maximum number of rolls delivered in a single order ?
#we are only concered with the the total number of delivered rolls, not the type of roll
SELECT * FROM 
customer_orders WHERE order_id in ( SELECT order_id FROM (SELECT *, CASE WHEN cancellation IN ('Cancellation','Customer Cancellation') THEN 'c' ELSE 'nc' END AS order_cancel_details FROM driver_order)a WHERE order_cancel_details='nc');
#from this we get to know about the rolls which is being delievrd succesfully, now we want to count rolls for single order
SELECT order_id,COUNT(roll_id) FROM(SELECT * FROM customer_orders WHERE order_id in ( SELECT order_id FROM (SELECT *, CASE WHEN cancellation IN ('Cancellation','Customer Cancellation') THEN 'c' ELSE 'nc' END AS order_cancel_details FROM driver_order)a WHERE order_cancel_details='nc'))b 
GROUP BY order_id;
